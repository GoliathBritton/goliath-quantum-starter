## üî¨ **Technical Analysis**

### **Why Portfolio Optimization Shows Quantum Advantage**

1. **Problem Complexity**: Portfolio optimization involves quadratic constraints and covariance matrices that scale exponentially with classical methods
2. **Quantum Parallelism**: Quantum annealing explores multiple solution paths simultaneously
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Quantum systems naturally handle complex financial constraints
4. **Solution Quality**: Quantum methods find globally optimal solutions vs. local optima

### **Why TSP and Knapsack Don't Show Advantage Yet**

1. **Problem Size**: Current benchmarks use small problem sizes (50 items) where classical methods excel
2. **Algorithm Maturity**: Quantum algorithms need optimization for these specific problem types
3. **Expected Behavior**: Quantum advantage typically appears at larger problem sizes (1000+ items)
