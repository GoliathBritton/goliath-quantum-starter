# üîç **DYNEX BUILD vs. BUY ANALYSIS + NQBA BUSINESS ASSESSMENT INTEGRATION**

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**RECOMMENDATION: PARTNER WITH DYNEX** - Building our own quantum computing platform would require $100M-$1B+ investment over 5-10 years. Instead, we've integrated comprehensive business assessment frameworks (IBP + BEMs) into the NQBA Stack, creating a **revolutionary quantum-enhanced business intelligence platform**.
