  - `ltc_logger.py` → All executions logged with thread ref ID
- 🗣 **Demo Agent (internal use)**:
  - CLI chatbot powered by NQBA decision logic
  - Routes optimization queries to Dynex → returns proof
  - Logs to LTC for traceability
- 📊 **Business Tie-In**:
  - Hook into one internal business (Sigma Select sales copilot)
  - Lead scoring demo → NQBA optimizes ranking in real time

### **Tasks (T7-T9)**
| Task | Description | DRI | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|-----|--------|-----|
| **T7** | Implement NQBA-Core MVP modules | Dev Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 3 |
| **T8** | Build demo agent with CLI interface | Dev Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 4 |
| **T9** | Integrate with Sigma Select business case | Product Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 4 |

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] NQBA-Core MVP successfully executes quantum operations
- [ ] Demo agent responds to queries and logs to LTC
- [ ] Lead scoring optimization working with real data
- [ ] Dynex integration functional for PoUW
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet baseline requirements

---

## 📅 **PHASE 3 (Week 5-6): Multi-Agent + SaaS Hook**

### **Objective**
Prove extensibility → set up SaaS model foundations.

### **Deliverables**
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
  - Build `agent_hub.py` → supports chatbots, voice agents, digital humans
  - First orchestration: chatbot + sales copilot both running via NQBA
- 🌐 **SaaS Integration Prep**:
  - Deploy NQBA-Core API (FastAPI wrapper)
  - Hook into sandbox SaaS module (CRM-lite for Sigma Select)
- 📢 **Investor Demo Prep**:
  - Demo: NQBA-powered sales agent optimizing deals + LTC proof
  - Show business crossover: FLYFOX AI (AIaaS), Goliath (finance), Sigma Select (sales)

### **Tasks (T10-T12)**
| Task | Description | DRI | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|-----|--------|-----|
| **T10** | Implement multi-agent orchestration | Dev Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 5 |
| **T11** | Deploy NQBA-Core API with FastAPI | DevOps Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 6 |
| **T12** | Prepare investor demo and documentation | Product Lead | ⏳ Pending | Week 6 |

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Multi-agent system operational with NQBA orchestration
- [ ] API endpoints functional and documented
- [ ] SaaS integration working with Sigma Select
- [ ] Investor demo ready with live examples
- [ ] All systems logging to LTC for traceability

## 🚨 **CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATION**

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Dynex API Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Integration takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Start with mock implementation, iterate with real API

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - **Risk**: NQBA-Core doesn't meet performance targets
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and optimization from day one

3. **Security Compliance**
   - **Risk**: Security gaps in quantum computing operations
   - **Mitigation**: Security review at each phase, external audit if needed

### **Medium Risk Items**
1. **Developer Onboarding**
   - **Risk**: Developers struggle with NQBA concepts
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and hands-on workshops

2. **Business Integration**
   - **Risk**: Sigma Select integration takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple use case, expand complexity gradually
