# FLYFOX AI: The Intelligence Economy, Powered by NQBA

## High Council → Q-Cortex → NQBA Core → Agents → SaaS

---

### What is FLYFOX AI?
A unified, quantum-powered business platform for the intelligence economy. At its core is NQBA (Neuromorphic Quantum Business Architecture), orchestrated by the Q-Cortex policy layer, delivering real-time, auditable business decisions to every agent and SaaS module.

---

## How It Works

1. **High Council**
   - Sets business objectives, risk/compliance guardrails, and strategic priorities (YAML directives).
2. **Q-Cortex (Quantum Cortex)**
   - Translates Council directives into dynamic, explainable decision policies.
   - Selects the best solver (quantum/classical) and agent for each request.
   - Ensures every action is logged in the Living Technical Codex (LTC).
3. **NQBA Core (Quantum Architect)**
   - Executes decisions and optimizations via pluggable quantum/classical adapters (Dynex-ready).
   - Exposes a secure, auditable API for all agents and SaaS modules.
4. **Agent Mesh**
   - Digital Humans, Voice/Calling Agents, Business Agents, and Chatbots—all powered by NQBA.
   - Each agent receives real-time, policy-driven instructions and returns LTC proofs.
5. **SaaS Layer**
   - Multi-tenant modules for Sigma Select (sales/lead intelligence), Goliath of All Trade (trading/portfolio/risk), and FLYFOX AI (agent marketplace).
