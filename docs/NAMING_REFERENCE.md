## **Rules for Usage**

### **1. First Reference Rule**
- **ALWAYS** spell out the full name on first reference
- **THEN** use the acronym in subsequent references
- **Example**: "The Neuromorphic Quantum Business Architecture (NQBA) provides... The NQBA system..."

### **2. Verification Rule**
- **NEVER** assume what an acronym means
- **ALWAYS** check this document first
- **ASK** if unsure about any acronym or system name

### **3. Context Rule**
- Use the full name when the context might be unclear
- Use acronyms only when the context is crystal clear
- When in doubt, use the full name

### **4. Consistency Rule**
- Once you've established the full name and acronym, use them consistently
- Don't switch between full names and acronyms randomly

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **❌ INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS**
- QHC = Quantum Health Consultants (WRONG)
- NQBA = Neural Quantum Business Architecture (WRONG)
- Assuming any acronym without verification

### **✅ CORRECT APPROACH**
- QHC = Quantum High Council (CORRECT)
- NQBA = Neuromorphic Quantum Business Architecture (CORRECT)
- Always verify before using
