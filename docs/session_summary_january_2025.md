3. **Core vs Optional** - Separating core dependencies from optional ones improves reliability

### Platform Architecture
1. **FastAPI Foundation** - Well-structured API server with GraphQL integration
2. **Quantum Integration** - Dynex and quantum computing capabilities built-in
3. **Modular Design** - Clear separation of concerns across components

### Documentation Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Document all procedures, issues, and solutions
2. **Practical Focus** - Include working examples and commands
3. **Maintenance Planning** - Regular review and update procedures

## Future Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Optional Dependencies** - Install remaining packages as needed
2. **Configuration** - Set up `dynex.ini` and API keys for full functionality
3. **Testing** - Resolve test dependency issues for comprehensive testing

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Docker Integration** - Containerize the application for easier deployment
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automate testing and deployment processes
3. **Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Security** - Review and enhance security configurations
